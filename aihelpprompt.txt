I'm working on my T Level Digital Production and Development OSP project - a zoo website with user authentication and booking system using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and vanilla JavaScript.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Backend: riget-zoo/server.js, riget-zoo/models/ (User.js, HotelBooking.js, Ticket.js)
- Frontend: riget-zoo/public/ (HTML files), riget-zoo/public/js/ (JavaScript files), riget-zoo/public/css/styles.css
- Database: MongoDB Atlas

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ User registration and login system working
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
✅ Backend routes for booking zoo tickets and hotel stays (with loyalty points system)
✅ Zoo ticket booking: users can select multiple ticket types (Adult £25, Child £15, Senior £20, Family £70) - awards 10 points per £1
✅ Hotel booking: users can select room type, check-in/out dates - awards 20 points per £1
✅ Booking page shows "Logged in as: [email]" and current loyalty points
✅ Real-time calculation of totals and points

FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
- server.js: has /register, /login, /api/book-zoo, /api/book-hotel, /api/user/:userId routes
- models/User.js: firstName, lastName, email, password, dateOfBirth, loyaltyPoints, createdAt
- models/Ticket.js: userId, ticketType, price, visitDate
- models/HotelBooking.js: userId, roomType, totalPrice, checkIn, checkOut
- public/js/login.js: handles login/registration forms
- public/js/profile.js: handles user profile page
- public/js/booking.js: handles zoo and hotel booking forms with real-time calculations
- public/booking-page.html: has both zoo ticket and hotel booking forms

TUTORIAL I'M FOLLOWING:
Parts 1-4 complete. Still need to implement:
- Part 5: User Dashboard (displaying bookings and loyalty points)
- Part 6: CRUD operations (cancelling bookings and updating points)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- When suggesting fixes, tell me WHERE I went wrong and HOW to correct it (don't just rewrite entire files)
- I need explanations suitable for T Level documentation
- Server runs on localhost:3000
- MongoDB connection string is in .env file
